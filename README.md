## R Code for "Unraveling the pain trajectory in chronic low back pain patients during a physical exercise training program"
This repository contains the R code used for the statistical analyses in the paper:

"Unraveling the pain trajectory in chronic low back pain patients during a physical exercise training program".

The purpose of this study was to explore the trajectory of low back pain intensity during a physical training program that included both aerobic and resistance exercises. It also tested whether acute exercise-induced pain relief was maintained throughout the program. The findings revealed that pain reduction was non-linear, with the greatest decrease occurring early in the program.

### **Reproducibility**

- **Software**: The analyses were performed using R version 4.2.1. The scripts also use linear mixed-effects models (LMMs). You'll need to install the necessary R packages for LMMs and any others you used (e.g., tidyverse, lme4).

- **Data**: The original dataset used for the analysis cannot be shared publicly due to IRB restrictions. As such, the code in this repository serves to demonstrate the analysis workflow and is not immediately reproducible.
